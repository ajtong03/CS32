# CS32
This repository contains my project solutions for CS 32 (Object-oriented Programming and Data Structures)

Project 3 was to create a game called SuperPeachSisters, modeled after SuperSmashBros. A general framework and source code was given to us, I worked on the files titled Actor.h, Actor.cpp, StudentWorld.h, and StudentWorld.cpp. 

Project 4 was a Dating app with the following functionalities:
  1. Each member has a profile consisting of name, email, and attributes
  2. Ability to store at least 100k profiles
  3. Ability to find all relevant matches for a member based on their attribute-value pairs
  4. Relevant matches should be ranked based on how compatible they are (i.e. # of shared attributes)
